# RediMedi
Pharmacy web application to help remind people to take their medicine through SMS.

## Why RediMedi
RediMedi was made to help people who don't check reminders or don't have good understanding of technology. Our target demographic was the elderly, the demographic which tends to know how to navigate messaging apps but not more complex applications. By having a quick, simple, and easy-to-understand website that allows you to edit SMS reminders without much issue, anybody can use RediMedi to make sure they're always ready to take their medicine.
